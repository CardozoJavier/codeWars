## Definition (Primorial Of a Number)
_Is similar to factorial of a number, **In primorial**, not all the natural numbers get multiplied, **only prime numbers are multiplied to calculate the primorial of a number**. It's denoted with **P**#._

## Task
_**Given** a number N , **calculate its primorial**_.

## Notes
_**Only positive** numbers will be passed (N > 0)_ .

## Input >> Output Examples:
### Explanation
```
1- numPrimorial (3) ==> return (30)
```
_**Since** the passed number is (3) ,**Then the primorial** should obtained by multiplying_ `2 * 3 * 5 = 30` .
**Mathematically written as , P3# = 30** .

### Explanation
```
2- numPrimorial (5) ==> return (2310)
```
_**Since** the passed number is (5) ,**Then the primorial** should obtained by multiplying_ `2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 = 2310` .
**Mathematically written as , P5# = 2310** .

### Explanation
```
3- numPrimorial (6) ==> return (30030)
```
_**Since** the passed number is (6) ,**Then the primorial** should obtained by multiplying_ `2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 = 30030` .
**Mathematically written as , P6# = 30030** .
